  <h3>Applications</h3><br><br><br>
  <h3> Healthcare:<br> </h3>
  <label>
      Administration: AI systems are helping with the routine, day-to-day administrative tasks to minimize human errors and maximize efficiency. Transcriptions of medical notes through NLP and helps structure patient information to make it easier for doctors to read it. <br><br>
  Telemedicine: For non-emergency situations, patients can reach out to a hospital’s AI system to analyze their symptoms, input their vital signs and assess if there’s a need for medical attention. This reduces the workload of medical professionals by bringing only crucial cases to them. <br><br>
  Assisted Diagnosis: Through computer vision and convolutional neural networks, AI is now capable of reading MRI scans to check for tumors and other malignant growths, at an exponentially faster pace than radiologists can, with a considerably lower margin of error. <br><br>
  Robot-assisted surgery: Robotic surgeries have a very minuscule margin-of-error and can consistently perform surgeries round-the-clock without getting exhausted. Since they operate with such a high degree of accuracy, they are less invasive than traditional methods, which potentially reduces the time patients spend in the hospital recovering. <br><br>
  Vital Stats Monitoring:  A person’s state of health is an ongoing process, depending on the varying levels of their respective vital stats. With wearable devices achieving mass-market popularity now, this data is not available on tap, just waiting to be analyzed to deliver actionable insights. Since vital signs have the potential to predict health fluctuations even before the patient is aware, there are a lot of live-saving applications here. <br><br>
  </label>
  
  <h3>E-commerce:<br></h3>
  <label>
  Better recommendations: This is usually the first example that people give when asked about business applications of AI, and that’s because it’s an area where AI has delivered great results already. Most large e-commerce players have incorporated Artificial Intelligence to make product recommendations that users might be interested in, which has led to considerable increases in their bottom-lines. <br><br>
  Chat bots: Another famous example, based on the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence chat bots across industries, and every other website we seem to visit. These chat bots are now serving customers in odd-hours and peak hours as well, removing the bottleneck of limited human resources. <br><br>
  Filtering spam and fake reviews: Due to the high volume of reviews that sites like Amazon receive, it would be impossible for human eyes to scan through them to filter out malicious content. Through the power of NLP, Artificial Intelligence can scan these reviews for suspicious activities and filter them out, making for a better buyer experience. <br><br>
  Optimizing search: All of the e-commerce depends upon users searching for what they want, and being able to find it. Artificial Intelligence has been optimizing search results based on thousands of parameters to ensure that users find the exact product that they are looking for. <br><br>
  Supply-chain: AI is being used to predict demand for different products in different timeframes so that they can manage their stocks to meet the demand. <br><br>
  
  </label>
  
  <h3>Human Resources:<br></h3>
  <label>
      Building work culture: AI is being used to analyze employee data and place them in the right teams, assign projects based on their competencies, collect feedback about the workplace, and even try to predict if they’re on the verge of quitting their company.  <br><br>
      Hiring: With NLP, AI can go through thousands of CV in a matter of seconds, and ascertain if there’s a good fit. This is beneficial because it would be devoid of any human errors or biases, and would considerably reduce the length of hiring cycles.
